This study investigates beat-level arrhythmia classification of ECG signals using classical machine-learning methods. Pre-processed ECG beats were converted into spectral feature representations and used to train six supervised classifiers: Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Model selection and hyperparameter tuning were performed using stratified cross-validation, and final performance was assessed on an independent test set of 21 412 beats using accuracy, macro-F1, confusion matrices, and ROC–AUC.
